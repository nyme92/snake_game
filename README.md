# snake_game
The Original Snake Game, developed in Python using Turtle

This Game is a replication of the Original Snake Game that was found on old,
black and white Nokia phones. 

Luckily, we don't need root access to install extra libraries, as this game 
uses already installed Libraries:
1. turtle
2. random
3. time

These libraries should be already installed on your computer. If not, easily go to your terminal and type "python". To install each of the three libraries, type "import", followed by the name of the library. 

To run game:

1. Download as Zip or Clone it to Folder.
2. In terminal, type python snake_game.py
3. Enjoy!!
